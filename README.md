## Project Overview

Marijuana arrests have been a topic of interest and debate in many regions. This project aims to explore the data related to marijuana arrests and conduct a thorough analysis to gain insights into various aspects of marijuana-related law enforcement.

The primary objectives of this project include:

- Analyzing the frequency of marijuana arrests over time
- Examining demographic patterns in marijuana arrests, such as age, gender, and race
- Investigating the geographical distribution of marijuana arrests
- Exploring the impact of marijuana legalization on arrest rates
- Identifying any disparities or biases in marijuana arrests

## Data Source

The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset obtained from [source], which provides detailed information about marijuana-related arrests. The dataset includes relevant attributes such as arrest date, demographics of the individuals involved, arrest location, and other pertinent variables.

## Data Analysis

The project utilizes various data analysis techniques, including descriptive statistics, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). These techniques help uncover meaningful insights and patterns within the dataset, enabling a deeper understanding of marijuana arrests.

Python programming language and popular libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and Plotly are employed to perform the data analysis tasks. The Jupyter Notebook environment is used to document and present the analysis process.

## Results and Findings

Throughout the analysis, several key findings and insights emerge, including:

- Temporal trends in marijuana arrests, indicating changes in enforcement patterns over time
- Demographic disparities, such as variations in arrest rates based on age, gender, and race
- Geographical hotspots for marijuana-related arrests, highlighting areas with higher enforcement activities
- Potential effects of marijuana legalization on arrest rates

The analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of marijuana arrests, offering valuable insights into the social, legal, and law enforcement aspects of this topic.
